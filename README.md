## Concept to demonstrate

- [ ] reach CLI
- [x] index.html and root div
- [x] render components to root
- [x] [strict mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html)
- [x] [function/class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [x] [jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- [x] [what is a fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)
- [ ] Where do you store services ?
- [ ] How do you make backend calls ?
- [ ] state and state management
- [ ] object destructuring
- [ ] props
- [ ] inserting javascript code in jsx
- [ ] reuse components
- [ ] list child (unique) key prop - used for efficient rendering
- [ ] binding input to prop
- [ ] refhook
- [ ] state values (never change directly)
- [ ] state update functions
- [ ] effects
- [ ] effect dependency
- [ ] effect function
- [ ]
