## Concept to demonstrate

- [x] reach CLI 
- [x] `npx create-react-app appName`
- [x] `npm start`
- [x] index.html and root div
- [x] render components to root
- [x] [strict mode](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html)
- [x] React Developer Tools (browser extension)
- [x] [function/class components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
- [x] [jsx](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)
- [x] [what is a fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html)
- [ ] export default ??
- [x] Services can go in a separate *.js
- [x] You can make backend calls with [fetch(built in)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch), [ajax(jquery)](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/), [axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- [x] You can define models as classes. If you want typechecking you should use react with [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [ ] How do you do [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)? (For example configuration settings)
- [x] state and state management
- [x] state values (never change directly)
- [x] state update functions
- [x] javascript [spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)
- [x] object destructuring
- [x] props
- [x] inserting javascript code in jsx. The code in between brackets {} is javascript code.
- [x] reuse components
- [x] [key props](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) 
- [x] binding input to prop
- [x] refhook
- [x] [effects](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) 
- [x] effect dependency
- [x] effect function
- [ ] error landing page
- [ ] integration in Wordpress
